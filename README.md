# STRYVE Frontend Coding Challenge

## Overview

- Your task is to create a small application that allows a user to browse through Pokemon!
- You have free reign over how application looks and can use any packages you wish to fulfil the brief below.

## Setup Instructions

- Install the necessary dependancies (npm install)
- Run 'npm run start' to start the application

## Task

- As a user, I can see a list of Pokemon, pulled from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/).
- As a user, I can click a single row to be taken to a different page and see more information about the Pokemon.
- As a user, I can see the type, abilities and an image of the selected Pokemon.

### Nice To Haves

- Use of TypeScript is a bonus, but if you don't feel comfortable, please rename App.tsx to App.js and carry on without it.
- Use of TailwindCSS for styling.
- Use of Jest for testing components.
- Addition of favicon and use of local images on landing page.
